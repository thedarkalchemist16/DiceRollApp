# DiceRollApp
This is the first android application I created in my journey as an Android Developer. The idea behind creating such a thing was , well , quite naive. College fests and events are places where people usually connect and form friends with which they probably share most of their lives. I got into college when COVID was at peak and had to live through most of my three semesters at home. The clubs and departments of my college did try their best to make us first yearites interact through various online events and fun activities. A dice might be a very common thing for everyday use but I was fascinating to having found a dice online and when i tried searching for it myself , I was quite shocked by the number of dices available online , so while begining this voyage of trying to be a successful Android Developer , this is one of the first things that came to my mind to work at. Fortunately , I came across the Google Android Developement Course and our first project was TO CREATE A DICE!! Hence , I learned quite a few things making this project and expect to learn a lot more pursuing this field!
